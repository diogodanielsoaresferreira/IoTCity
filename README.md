# IoTCity

Project presented in Informatic Engineering Project course (Universidade de Aveiro), 2017.


The web application was made with Django framework in Python.
The main goal of the software is to develop a management, monitoring and actuation platform over the city data in real-time.
It stores the values received from various sensors of several types in a city (temperature, waste containers, visible radiation, infrared,
Co2, ...) and shows the to the city manager. Besides that, it allows to define alarms according to the values received form the sensors,
and act in actuators (e.g. turn on the city lights) when alarms are triggered.
